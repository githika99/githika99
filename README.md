<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  I'm a senior studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science at UCSC. I've worked in Web Development, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning. I'm currently working on a variety of Data Analysis projects! I am currently seeking full-time positions that start after Spring 2025. In my free time, I enjoy biking, swimming, and generally spending time in nature. I also love taking my time to cook special dishes! I'm always looking to connect with those with similar interests, so feel free to reach out over <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/githika99/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:gannapur@ucsc.com">email me</a>.
